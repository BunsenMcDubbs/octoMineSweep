octoMineSweep
=============
octoMineSweep is a MineSweeper game written in Java for a school project.

The class to start the game is in src/test/Gui.java (source code) or bin/test/Gui.class for the compiled Java binary.

The source folder is divided into a test package containing code that starts the game, backend package for the actual game mechanics (including a Events subpackage for handling different events that occur in the game), and finally a frontend package for the GUI representation of the game and mouse interactivity.
