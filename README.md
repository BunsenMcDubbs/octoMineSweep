octoMineSweep
=============
octoMineSweep is a MineSweeper game written in Java for a school project.

The class to start the game is in src/test/Gui.java (source code) or bin/test/Gui.class for the compiled Java binary. The binaries are not included in the repository and compilation will be necessary before the game can be run (... slightly obvious).

The source folder is divided into a test package containing code that starts the game, backend package for the actual game mechanics (including a Events subpackage for handling different events that occur in the game), and finally a frontend package for the GUI representation of the game and mouse interactivity.
